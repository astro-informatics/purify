Description
-------------

**PURIFY** is an open-source collection of routines written in `C++` available under the [license](#license) below. It implements different tools and high-level to perform radio interferometric imaging, _i.e._ to recover images from the Fourier measurements taken by radio interferometric telescopes. 

**PURIFY** leverages recent developments in the field of compressive sensing and convex optimization. Low-level functionality to solve the resulting convex optimisation is factored into the open-source companion code, [**SOPT**](https://github.com/astro-informatics/sopt), also written by the authors of **PURIFY**. For further background please see the [reference](#references-and-citation) section.

This documentation outlines the necessary and optional [dependencies](#dependencies-installation) upon which **PURIFY** should be built, before describing [installation](#installing-and-building-PURIFY), [testing](#testing) and [usage](#usage) details. [Contributors](#contributors), [references](#references-and-citation) and [license](#license) information then follows.

Dependencies installation
-------------------------

**PURIFY** is written in `C++11`. Pre-requisites and dependencies are listed in following and minimal versions required are tested against `Travis CI` meaning that they come natively with OSX and the Ubuntu Trusty release. These are also the default ones fetched by `CMake` (an internet connection is required for this).

`C++` minimal dependencies:

- [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) v3.5.1 (Trusty as `cmake3`) A free software that allows cross-platform compilation
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) v7.3.0 GNU compiler for `C++`
- [UCL/GreatCMakeCookOff](https://github.com/UCL/GreatCMakeCookOff) Collection of `CMake` recipes.
  Downloaded automatically if absent
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) v1.54 (Trusty). A set of free peer-reviewed
  portable C++ libraries. V1.65 downloaded automatically if absent but needs a
  cmake >= 3.9.2.

  for reading and writing data files in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data format.
  Downloaded automatically if absent.
- [casacore](http://casacore.github.io/casacore/) - Optional - Needed to interface with measurement
  sets. The main purify program requires this library (and its dependencies)

  unit-testing framework only needed for testing. Downloaded automatically if absent.

  micro-benchmarking framework only needed for benchmarks. Downloaded automatically if absent.

Installing and building PURIFY
-------------------------------------

**PURIFY** can be installed through the software packet manager on Linux Debian distributions:

```
sudo apt-get install purify
```

Alternatively, you can build **PURIFY** entirely from the source code. Once the mandatory dependencies are present, `git clone` from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/astro-informatics/purify):

```
git clone https://github.com/astro-informatics/purify.git
```

Then, the program can be built using Conan:

``` bash
cd /path/to/code
mkdir build
conan install . -if ./build --build missing 
conan build . -bf ./build
```

You can turn the various options on and off by adding flags to the `conan install` command, e.g.

```bash
conan install . -if ./build --build missing -o openmp=on -o mpi=off
```

To test everything went all right:

``` bash
cd /path/to/code/build
ctest .
```

To install in directory `/X`, with libraries going to `X/' do:

```
cd /path/to/code/build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/X ..
make install
```

Testing
-------

To check everything went all right, run the test suite:

```
cd /path/to/code/build
ctest .
```

Usage
------

The main purify executable lives either in the build directory or in the in the `bin` subdirectory
of the installation directory. `purify` has one required argument, it a string for the file path of the config file containing the settings.

`purify path/to/config.yaml`.

A [template with a description of the settings](https://github.com/astro-informatics/purify/blob/development/data/config/config.yaml)
is included in the `data/config` directory.`
When `purify` runs a directory will be created, and the output images will be
saved and time-stamped. Additionally, a config file with the settings used will
be saved and time-stamped, helping for reproducibility and book-keeping.

Docker
-------

If you want to use Docker instead, you can build an image using the Dockerfile
available in the repository or pulling it from
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/uclrits/purify).

```
docker build -t purify .
```

or

```
docker pull uclrits/purify
```

Then to use it, you should mount the directory with your data and config files
to `/mydata` in the container. To run the container and mount the directory is
with:

```
docker run -it --name purify -v /full/path/to/data:/mydata uclrits/purify
```

That will start a shell inside the container in the `/mydata` directory where
you can see all the files from your `/full/path/to/data`. There you can run
`purify` as shown above.`

CMake Tips
----------

It is possible to tell ``CMake`` exactly which libraries to compile and link against. The general
idea is to add ``-DVARIABLE=something`` to the command-line arguments of CMake. CMake can be called
any number of times: previous settings will not be overwritten unless specifically
requested. Some of the more common options are the following:

-  ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``: CMake will look in "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH/lib"
   for libraries, "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH/include" for headers, etc.
-  ``FFTW3_LIBRARIES``, ``FFTW3_INCLUDE_DIR``
-  ``BLAS_INCLUDE_DIRS``, ``BLAS_LIBRARIES``

All these variables and more can be found and modified in the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file in the build
directory. There are extra CMake options sepcific to purify. ``-Ddompi=ON`` will turn MPI on in the build, ``-Dopenmp=ON`` will turn openmp on for the build. ``-Dtests=ON`` will make sure tests are built.

``ctest`` should be run to make sure the unit tests pass.
