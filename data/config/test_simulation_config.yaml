### Config file for Purify
GeneralConfiguration:
  InputOutput:
    input:
      # If the following parameter is "measurements", only the measurements block should
      # be provided, and the measurements will be read from file. If it's "simulation", only the
      # simulation block should be provided, and random measurements of the given
      # image will be generated with the requested noise.
      source: simulation # one from measurements, simulation
      simulation:
        skymodel: /path/to/sky/image # path to the sky model image file
        signal_to_noise: 10 # signal-to-noise ratio to be added to the sky model
    output_path: /path/to/output/dir # results directory will be created inside this path, and called output_<timestamp>

  ### Execution parameters
  logging: debug # How much logging you want (debug, critical, ..)# FIXME: add the options, compile?
  iterations: 100 # number of iterations (>= 0)
  epsilonScaling: 1 # RMS noise (> 0)
  gamma: default # Stepsize, choose value between: default, variable, 100, x
  ## modelImage:  # If none epsilonL2 * RealImage # FIXME - maybe to delete

########## Measure Operators ##########
MeasureOperators:
  pixelSize:
    Dx: 1
    Dy: 1
  imageSize: # for the moment: power of two
    x: 1024
    y: 1024
  J: # Interpolation pixels (default 4x4). Input either a value or pair
    Jx: 4
    Jy: 4
  Jweights: kb # kernel, choose between: kb, Gauss, box
  oversampling: 2 # value > 1
  powMethod_iter: 100 # value > 0
  powMethod_tolerance: 1e-4 # value > 0
  # TODO: Add others like weighting. (at the moment natural)

########## SARA ##########
SARA:
  # wavelet bases, to choose from: Dirac, DB1, ..., DBn (where n=0 is dirac, and 1 <= n <= 35 is DB basis)
  wavelet_dict: 0..8 # sequence of desired basis: 0,23,31 or 0,12..16,20
  wavelet_levels: 4 # value for all

AlgorithmOptions:
  algorithm: padmm # will just read the options of that one.
  ########## PADMM ##########
  padmm:
    epsilonConvergenceScaling: 1 # Default 1 (>0)
    realValueConstraint: True # Boolean
    positiveValueConstraint: True #boolean
    # Following is only accepted when MPI is used
    mpiAlgorithm:  fully-distributed # 1,2 or 3 - from the list of the possible algorithms - NOTE this changes the MO.; FIXME: Names as in paper
      #  (0) none, (1) fully-distributed, (2) serial-equivalent, (3) partially-distributed
    # Be careful changing the following unless you know what you are doing
    relVarianceConvergence: 1e-3 # (>0)

  pd: # this is ignored if not chosen in algorithm.
    param1: none # something
    param2: none # something else
