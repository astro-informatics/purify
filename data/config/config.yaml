### Config file for Purify
Version: 3.1.0
GeneralConfiguration:
  InputOutput:
    input:
      # If the following parameter is "measurements", only the measurements block should
      # be provided, and the measurements will be read from file. If it's "simulation", only the
      # simulation block should be provided, and random measurements of the given
      # image will be generated with the requested noise.
      source: measurements # one from measurements, simulation
      measurements:
        measurements_files:
          - /path/to/measurment/set # path to the measurement set
        measurements_polarization: I # one from I Q V XX LL
        measurements_units: radians # one from lambda, radians, pixels
        measurements_sigma: 1 # the uncertainty of a visibility (RMS noise of a visibility in Jy)
        warm_start: /path/to/warm/start/image #path to fits file image of previous purify solution (assumig the same cell size), otherwise leave as an empty quotation ""
      #simulation:
      #  skymodel: /path/to/sky/image # path to the sky model image file, the ground truth image for the simulation
      #  signal_to_noise: 30 # signal-to-noise ratio to be added to the sky model
      #  number_of_measurements: 10000 # number of measurements per a node
      #  w_rms: 30. # RMS w value in random uvw coverage
      #  sim_J: 8 # the minimum support for the kernel when simulating measurements
      #  coverage_files:  #path to converage units. This is only used if it is not an empty string
      #    - path/to/coverage/measurement/file
      #  coverage_units: lambda # one from lambda, radians, pixels
    output_prefix: /path/to/output/dir # results directory will be created inside this path, and called output_<timestamp>

  ### Execution parameters
  logging: debug # How much logging you want (debug, critical, ..). debug maybe the most useful in some cases because it gives the most output.
  iterations: 100 # number of iterations (>= 0). More iterations can give better results.
  epsilonScaling: 1 # factor to scale measurements_sigma by. We suggest 1, but it can be useful to change.

########## Measure Operators ##########
MeasureOperators:
  pixelSize: #pixel size in arcseconds. This should be estimated from the longest baseline (PURIFY should print out a suggestion)
    cellsizex: 1
    cellsizey: 1
  imageSize: # for the moment: power of two . For a simulation or when using a warm start, this must be same image size as the ground truth
    width: 1024
    height: 1024
  J: # Interpolation pixels for the anti-aliasing kernel (default 4x4). Input either a value or pair  (J == 6 is the only option for pswf)
    Jx: 4
    Jy: 4
    Jw: 30 #Maximum size of w kernel
  kernel: kb # kernel, choose between: kb, Gauss, box, pswf 
  oversampling: 2 # value > 1. Value of 2 is the standard
  gpu: False #This can be used when compiled with arrayfire gpu library
  powermethod:
    iters: 100 # value > 0. This is the maximum number of iterations used with the power method for calculating the measurement operator norm.
    tolerance: 1e-4 # value > 0. This is the tolerance for convergence of the operator norm
    eigenvector: #Here we can choose real and imaginary fits images of the operator eigenvector associated with the operator norm. This speeds up convergence for repeat runs.
      real:  ""
      imag:  ""
  wide-field:
    wprojection: False # using radially symmetric w projection kernel
    mpi_wstacking: False # applies average w-stack correction on each node (always True with wprojection)
    mpi_all_to_all: False # performs all to all operation of the grid to even out computation. Highly recommended when using MPI for wide-field imaging!
    conjugate_w: True #reflects measurements onto the positive w-domain (can reduce computation)
    kmeans_iterations: 100 #number of iterations in w-stacking clustering algorithm

########## SARA ##########
SARA:
  # wavelet bases, to choose from: Dirac, DB1, ..., DBn (where n=0 is dirac, and 1 <= n <= 35 is DB basis)
  wavelet_dict: 0..8 # sequence of desired basis: 0,23,31 or 0,12..16,20 . We typically use 0..8, this gives good results but will be expensive for large images.
  wavelet_levels: 4 # maximum number of wavelet levels for each dictionary. More levels can be good for increasing quality of large scale structures in an image (we recommend 4 to 6).
  realValueConstraint: True # Boolean, we recommend this to be True for Stokes I
  positiveValueConstraint: True # Boolean, we recommend this to be True for Stokes I

AlgorithmOptions:
  algorithm: primaldual # will just read the options of that one. We recommend the primal dual algorithm, especially for large image sizes.
