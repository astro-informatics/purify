    Tests each kernel by gridding visibility data and a point spread function, then comparing the gridded images to the same images generated from matlab.

    So far the maximum difference between the gridded images of at166B are 0.00015% (kb), 0.1071% (pswf), and 0.0362% (guass).

    Since there is small difference between the end results, it suggests that the C++ and Matlab codes perform the same process.
    But, it is not clear why the pswf and guass kernels are not as close to the matlab versions as the kb kernel.

  /*
    Degrids a model point source, and then compares how close the degridded visibilities are to that of a point source.

    Also generates a degridded image of M31.
  
    We find the maximum difference in visibilities is 0.001% (kb), 0.842% (pswf), and 0.056% (gauss).

    Again, the kb Kernel gives closer to the expected result. PSWF gives a result that is worse than expected.
